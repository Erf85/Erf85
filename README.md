- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Erf85
I am from Japan. after many years working as a nutritionist in Japan,I have lived in three countries and now,I ended up in Germany.
I have never thought aboout learning code but since someone told me what he had done, I changed the view. I taught myself HTML and CSS a few years ago 
but stopped doing,but I was always looking for an oppotunity to start and finally,I can start learning.I am excited to step forward and meet a new world
